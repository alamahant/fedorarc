FedoraRC - OpenRC for Fedora

This repository contains scripts and configurations to bootstrap Fedora
with OpenRC + elogind + netifrc instead of systemd.

How to Use:

First create a Fedora minimal VM or Incus container.

Disable Selinux in /etc/selinux/config and either stop firewalld or open port 22 for ssh.
Especially for selinux it is ESSENTIAL that you keep it disabled or permissive until a policy solution is set.

Then, from within that VM:

Clone the repository in /root folder:
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/alamahant/fedorarc.git

Copy the transformation script to /root:
cp fedorarc/scripts/deliver-us-from-evil.sh /root/

Run as root:
chmod +x deliver-us-from-evil.sh
./deliver-us-from-evil.sh

The script will install dependencies, build OpenRC components,
configure the system, and remove systemd runtime traces.

After Installation:

If you install a package with a daemon using DNF,
look in init.d/services/.
If its script is found there, move it to init.d/.

Likewise, check conf.d/config/ for its configuration file.
If found, move it to conf.d/.

Then test the service.
If you encounter any problems, please open an issue.
Also open an issue if your desired daemon and configuration
are missing from the existing files.

Compatibility:

Tested on Fedora.
May also work on RHEL derivatives.

Warning:

This project is experimental.
Always test in virtual machines or incus containers before committing to bare metal.
