FedoraRC - OpenRC for Fedora

This repository contains scripts and configurations to bootstrap Fedora
with OpenRC + elogind + netifrc instead of systemd.

HOW TO USE:

First create a Fedora minimal VM or Incus container.

Disable Selinux in /etc/selinux/config and either stop firewalld or open port 22 for SSH.
Especially for SELinux, it is ESSENTIAL that you keep it disabled or permissive until a policy solution is set.

Then, from within that VM:

Clone the repository in /root folder:
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/alamahant/fedorarc.git

Copy the transformation script to /root:
cp fedorarc/scripts/deliver-us-from-evil.sh /root/

Run as root:
chmod +x deliver-us-from-evil.sh
./deliver-us-from-evil.sh

The script will install dependencies, build OpenRC components,
configure the system, and remove systemd runtime traces.

DUAL BOOT OPTION:

A new script named coexist-with-evil.sh was added to enable dual boot between OpenRC and systemd.

If you wish to explore this scenario then please use:
./coexist-with-evil.sh

instead of:
./deliver-us-from-evil.sh

INIT SYSTEM SELECTOR:

For dual boot systems, there is an init system selector script placed at
/usr/local/bin/select_init 
that easily lets you select your desired init system for next boot.

Usage:

select_init openrc
select_init systemd
select_init status

Features:

    Easily select your init system

    Changes take effect on next boot

    No complex configuration editing required

    Perfect for testing and development environments

AFTER INSTALLATION:

If you install a package with a daemon using DNF:

    Look in init.d/services/. If its script is found there, move it to init.d/.

    Check conf.d/config/ for its configuration file. If found, move it to conf.d/.

    Then test the service.

If you encounter any problems, please open an issue.
Also open an issue if your desired daemon and configuration are missing from the existing files.

COMPATIBILITY:

Tested on Fedora.
May also work on RHEL derivatives.

WARNING:

This project is experimental.
Always test in virtual machines or incus containers before committing to bare metal.
