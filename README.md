FedoraRC

FedoraRC is an experimental project that transforms Fedora and related distributions to run with OpenRC, elogind, and netifrc instead of systemd.
Its purpose is to provide an alternative initialization framework while maintaining compatibility with Fedora’s package management and runtime environment.

This repository contains configuration files, initialization scripts, and supporting utilities designed to integrate OpenRC seamlessly into Fedora-based systems.
It is intended for advanced users who understand the implications of replacing systemd and wish to explore or develop a fully OpenRC-driven Fedora system.

For detailed setup and usage instructions, please read INSTRUCTIONS.txt included in this repository.
